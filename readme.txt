A program with the capability to read and output the relationships within MySQL databases. These relationships are then output in the form of javascript/HTML5, which can be graphed on our web app. The web app serves as a platform to request the specific data you want graphed. On the app, you are able to apply various filters and choose which type of graph you want to be output.  The final output consists of a visual representation of the graph as well as the javascript code to portray that graph on other web pages. This project was completed as part of a team of Daniel Edwards, Will Stalcup and Will Theuer at the 2014 TribeHacks competition. All members of the team are members of the William and Mary Class of 2017.
